Organize-MP3
============

Organizes mp3 files.

Only dependency is eyed3 project on https://bitbucket.org/nicfit/eyed3. It was quiet unstable so I included the project files. Drop these organizer.py, eyed3 files to your messy mp3s and run organizer.py.

MP3 files will be moved to

    author/album/file-name.mp3

You can specify some banned words to remove from mp3 meta information. Just read the code it's easy.
